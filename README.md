Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software Engeneering is the process of building and mantaining of softwares.
Importance:Provides a reliable way to build dynamic websites.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1:Internet of Things - This is the sharing of data and communicaton between different objects in the internet.
2:Software Testing - This is the way of testing whether a software satisfies the expectations.
3:Deployment Method - This is the process of making the website live on production

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1:Planning
Involves gathering requirements from the customer and documenting them 
2:Design
Involves creating a blueprint for the software, including user interfaces, system interfaces, and databases 
3:Testing
Involves testing the software to ensure it meets requirements and functions properly 
4:Deployment
Involves moving the software from the testing environment to the operating environment 
5:Maintenance
Involves monitoring the application for issues that arise once it is in production 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear, sequential approach to project management where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
-Best for projects with clear, fixed requirements
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle.
-Suitable for software development, startups, and dynamic environments

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing and validation.
Project Manager: Oversees project planning, execution, and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs eg; VS Code:  Collaboration & Teamwork – Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts
                    Branching & Merging – Developers can create separate branches for features, bug fixes, and experiments.

VCS eg; git :Debugging Support – Built-in debuggers help developers identify and fix errors quickly.
             Code Efficiency & Productivity – Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring tools speed up development.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Complex Issues- Use debugging tools 
Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology- Join developer communities 
Effective Communication in Teams- Follow stand-up meetings 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
               Catches small errors early, making debugging easier.
Integration: Testing how different modules or components interact with each other.
              Detects data flow issues between components.
Acceptance: Final phase of testing to determine if the system meets business and user requirements.
             Ensures software meets business requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engeneering is the trainng of AI into generating useful and relevant responses.
       -> Enhances Response Quality-Well-structured prompts help AI generate more accurate, relevant, and coherent responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about Python." -- "Explain the key features of Python that make it suitable for web development, and provide examples of popular web frameworks."
   ->Clarity – Specifies the focus on web development rather than a general overview of Python.
